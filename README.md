Implemented a strategy for making decisions about buy orders for a particular stock, in this case, AAPL (Apple Inc.), based on daily returns.

Here's a breakdown of the steps your code is performing:

Data Collection: You're creating a database for US stock data, collecting free daily historical data for AAPL, and creating a universe for active AAPL stocks.

Fetching Prices: You're fetching the daily close prices for AAPL for the year 2023.

State Classification: You're classifying the states of each day based on the daily returns (rd). If the return is greater than or equal to 0.01, the state is classified as 1. If it's between -0.01 and 0.01, the state is classified as 0. Otherwise, it's classified as -1.

Value Function Calculation: You're calculating the portfolio value (vd) based on the state transitions. If the current state is 0 and the next state is 1, the portfolio value increases by 1. If the next state is -1, the portfolio value decreases by 1. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.

Summation of States: You're summing up the states to analyze the overall behavior of the strategy.
